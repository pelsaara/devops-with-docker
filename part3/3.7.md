Docker is a tool that is supposed to make deployind and running applications easier by creating containers where the applications are run. In the containers the created app runs with all the libraries and all the dependencies it needs. That means everyone who runs the app does not need all of these required libraries and dependencies with the correct version etc on their local computer, but they come as a package when you build the container. Docker is easy and simple to set up and it has multiple Docker containers already created in the Docker Hub that anyone can use as a base for their application. 

Docker also makes environment management and continuous integreation very easy. It's easy to maintain different versions in different containers and it works with for example Travis and Jenkins. Docker could be used when you are learning new technologies and want to play with them in an isolated and disposale environment. Docker is also useful when you want to set up an environment that is probably created many times, because it usually is available as an ready-made image in Docker Hub. If you run multiple applications on one server, containers is an easy way to manage apps different dependencies.
